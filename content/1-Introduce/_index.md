In today’s modern software development landscape, designing and developing APIs is no longer a secondary task — it has become the core foundation of application architecture. With the **API-First Development** approach, entire systems are built around well-defined API specifications, ensuring consistency, reusability, and accelerated development speed.

This project implements a **complete API-First development platform on AWS**, integrating modern tools and services such as:

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Standardizes API design from the very beginning.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates server and client code from OpenAPI files.
- **AWS Lambda & API Gateway**: Deploys APIs using a serverless architecture.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores data using a scalable and efficient NoSQL model.
- **CodePipeline & CodeBuild**: Fully automates the CI/CD workflow.
- **Jest & Coverage**: Ensures quality through automated testing and coverage analysis.
- **Redoc**: Automatically generates clean, interactive API documentation from OpenAPI specs.

### Objectives

Establish a modern API development workflow with:

- API-first design methodology
- Automatic code generation
- Integrated testing and documentation
- Deployment automation on AWS

### Why This Project?

- Reduces API development and maintenance time by up to 70%
- Resolves inconsistencies between code and documentation
- Builds a scalable, reusable platform for future projects
